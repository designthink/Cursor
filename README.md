# Cursor Rules &amp; Prompts

## Cursor UI Design Prompt
This is a platform-adaptive UI Design prompt for use in Cursor chat. Use it to creating native-looking user interfaces across different platforms (iPhone, iPad, macOS, and Web).

### If you just want to try it out:
1. Just paste the entire prompt into chat and hit enter.
2. Then enter a description of your app or feature idea.

### If you plan to use this prompt regularly:
The best way is to create a "Custom Mode" for Cursor chat:
1. Enable [custom modes](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/custom-modes) in Cursor: `Settings` → `Features` → `Chat` → `Custom modes`
2. Open the mode menu in chat and click `Add custom mode`.
3. Enter a name for the custom mode (e.g. "Generate UI")
4. Set your preferred model (I recommend `claude-4-sonnet`)
5. Optionally create a keyboard shortcut
6. Click on 'Advanced options' and paste in the entire Cursor UI design prompt
7. Make sure 'Generate UI' mode is selected in the chat, and enter a description of your app or feature idea.
