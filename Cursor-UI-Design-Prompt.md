# Cursor Platform-Adaptive UI Design Prompt

## WORKFLOW

**Please provide the following information:**

### STEP 1: Gather Requirements
Ask these questions ONE AT A TIME, waiting for answers:
1. **Platform?** → `[A: iPhone, B: iPad, C: macOS, D: Web]`
2. **Orientation?** → `[P: Portrait, L: Landscape]`
3. **References?** → `[Are there any apps that represent the UI, category, or aesthetic style you are aiming for (Optional/N)]`

### STEP 2: Application Details
4. **Application Name**: [Enter app name - this will be used for the HTML filename]
5. **Brief Description**: [Describe the main purpose and key features of your application]
6. **Primary User Actions**: [List 3-5 main things users will do in this app]

### STEP 3: Plan
7. Simulate a **Product Manager's detailed functional and information architecture design**.

## Generated Prompt Template

Based on your selections above, use this prompt to generate a complete **UI design plan**:

```
## Role
You are a **senior front-end developer and UI designer** specializing in [PLATFORM] applications. Follow these instructions EXACTLY.

## Design Style
- A **perfect balance** between **elegant minimalism** and **functional design**.
- **[PLATFORM]-native design patterns** that feel familiar to users.
- **Soft, refreshing gradient colors** that seamlessly integrate with [PLATFORM] design guidelines.
- **Well-proportioned white space** for a clean layout.
- **Light and immersive** user experience following [PLATFORM] Human Interface Guidelines.
- **Clear information hierarchy** using **platform-appropriate shadows and layouts**.
- **Natural focus on core functionalities**.
- **[PLATFORM]-standard corner radius and spacing**.
- **Delicate micro-interactions** that match [PLATFORM] conventions.
- **Comfortable visual proportions** optimized for [DEVICE].
- **Use REAL, relevant content** - NO lorem ipsum, NO placeholder text

## Technical Specifications
1. **Page Dimensions**: [DIMENSIONS] and [ORIENTATION] with appropriate frame/viewport for [PLATFORM].
2. **Icons**: Use **Lucide React icons** or similar (icons **must not** have background blocks).
3. **Images**: Must be sourced from **Unsplash/Pexels** via direct links.
4. **Styles**: Use **Tailwind CSS** via **CDN** with custom classes to simulate [PLATFORM] appearance.
5. **Components**: Implement [PLATFORM]-style components (buttons, cards, navigation, etc.).
6. **User Input**: Implement [PLATFORM]-style user input fields and controls (form fields, text areas, switches, sliders) as required.
7. **Typography**: Use [PLATFORM_FONTS] or web-safe equivalents.
8. **Color Scheme**: Follow [PLATFORM] color guidelines with proper contrast ratios.
9. **Interactions**: Simulate [PLATFORM]-specific gestures and transitions where applicable.

## Viewport Safety Requirements (CRITICAL)
- **Content Boundaries**: ALL content MUST be contained within viewport dimensions
- **Safe Margins**: Maintain minimum 16px padding from viewport edges
- **Overflow Prevention**: Use `overflow: hidden` on viewport containers
- **Fixed Positioning**: Ensure fixed elements stay within viewport bounds
- **Modal/Overlay Positioning**: Center modals with proper max-width/height constraints
- **Navigation Bars**: Lock to viewport edges without extending beyond
- **Scrollable Areas**: Implement internal scrolling within defined regions only

## Critical UI Elements (MUST BE VISIBLE)
- **Primary User Actions**: MUST include all controls/buttons for the main user actions specified in requirements
- **Input Fields**: MUST include any required text inputs, forms, or data entry areas
- **Interactive Elements**: MUST ensure all clickable/tappable elements are clearly identifiable
- **Navigation Elements**: MUST include any required navigation, menus, or wayfinding controls
- **Visual Hierarchy**: MUST make the most important actions/controls the most prominent

## Layout Requirements
- **Primary Actions**: Most important user actions MUST be prominently positioned
- **Input Areas**: Any required data entry MUST be clearly visible and accessible
- **Visual Prominence**: Critical controls MUST have sufficient contrast and sizing
- **Logical Flow**: Interface MUST guide users through intended workflows
- **Multiple Screens**: When showing variations or flows, display them **horizontally** with clear separation

## Platform-Specific Guidelines
[PLATFORM_SPECIFIC_RULES]

## Task
Create **[APP_NAME]** - [APP_DESCRIPTION]

Key Features:
[USER_ACTIONS_LIST]

Requirements:
- Simulate a **[PLATFORM] native application** appearance using HTML/CSS.
- Follow the **design style** and **technical specifications** to generate a complete **UI design**.
- Create a **[APP_NAME].html** file that contains the main interface.
- Include platform-appropriate navigation, inputs and controls.
- Ensure responsive behavior appropriate for [DEVICE].
- When creating multiple screens, arrange them **horizontally** in the same file.

Generate the complete application interface now. When finished, offer to run/open the generated html file.
```

- Label each screen clearly (e.g., "Screen 1: Login", "Screen 2: Dashboard")
- Maintain consistent viewport dimensions across all screens
